# ModernCppPractice_HashTable
One of my training project , it's a simple implementation of hash table in cpp using modern tools 

In this simple implementation the collision is not managed using probing but simply stored in a vector (less efficient but easier #Just a training project :p)
My goals was to use as much as possible modern cpp features lambda , constexpr , metaprogramming , etc ... as well as reading about hash table to get a better 
understanding of the differents possible mechanisms .

If you ever read this feel free to do as you want with this code and you can reach me for questions at sammedhi2@hotmail.fr !
